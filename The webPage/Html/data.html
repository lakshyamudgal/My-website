        <p>Mona and Raju were excited about proposed first trip to a hill station, Shimla with
their parents. While they were packing their clothes, their mother asked them to pack
some woolen clothes also. They reside in Chennai, a city and capital of Tamil Nadu,
a state in South India. They were really surprised as it was the month of May and
it’s very hot in Chennai. Their mother told that although India has monsoon climate
but in Shimla, it being a hill station the weather was cool. They were little confused
with a few questions in their mind like - what is weather? What is the difference
between the weather and the climate? Why do we find different climatic conditions
in India? You will find the answers to such questions in the following lesson.</p>

   <p>Location: The places which are closer to equator have high temperature. As
one moves towards the poles temperature decreases. As our country, India is
located in Northern hemisphere closer to equator at 8°4¢ and 23½° Tropic of
Cancer passes through the central part of India. So in south of this latitude we
find tropical climate and towards the north we find sub-tropical climate. For
example, Andhra Pradesh would be hotter than Haryana. Broadly speaking parts
lying south of the Tropic of Cancer receive more solar heat than those lying north
of it.</p><p>Location: The places which are closer to equator have high temperature. As
